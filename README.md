# CS Institute workshop on Data Science
This repository contains presentation information and demo material for the CS Institute

## Intro to Data Science
* Workshop Leader: Pete Alonzi, Data Scientist (UVA Data Science Institute)
* Grades: 9-12
* Description: Explore Project Jupyter as a way to introduce data science explorations in your classroom.

## Today's Plan
1. Terminology
2. Discuss goals
3. Get our hands dirty and have some fun

# Terminology
One of the toughest thing about data science is that no one agrees on what it means.
* "The term “data scientist” was coined as recently as 2008 when companies realized the need for data professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data." ~ https://datascience.berkeley.edu
* "Data science continues to evolve ... " ~ https://datascience.berkeley.edu/about/what-is-data-science/
* "Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data." ~ Wikipedia

## Extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data
Let's talk about knowledge and insights.

I'll believe you can write a program that extracts knowledge. But I won't go so far with regards to insights.

## Pete's definition of Data Science
![](https://github.com/alonzi/CSInstitute/blob/master/researchFlowchart.png)
What we face today is data on a global scale. Megabytes have become Gigabytes have become Terabytes and so on. Now we must use computers to aid our science. But we cannot forget that the human brain is where the magic happens. In fact the most advanced machine learning techniques are nambed after the brain, we call them artificial neural networks.

**"Data Science is the process of uploading data into the human brain."** ~ Pete Alonzi

## Example and Questions
Let's play a game: How long would it take to drive from here (799 Faulconer Drive) to Mas Tapas (904 Monticello Road)?

My qestion to you: Why does google give us three options? (hint: think back to Bloom's Taxonomy and my definition)
