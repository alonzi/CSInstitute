3. Get our hands dirty and have some fun

# Terminology
One of the toughest thing about data science is that no one agrees on what it means.
* "The term “data scientist” was coined as recently as 2008 when companies realized the need for data professionals who are skilled in organizing and analyzing massive amounts of data." ~ https://datascience.berkeley.edu
* "Data science continues to evolve ... " ~ https://datascience.berkeley.edu/about/what-is-data-science/
* "Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data." ~ Wikipedia
